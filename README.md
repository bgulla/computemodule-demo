# Get started with Compute Modules
![computemodule-overview](/python/static/00_cm_overview.png)
## Start developing with our Compute Modules quick start guides:

* **Call custom containers or models from Workshop modules or Slate applications:** Write a container function that can be queried from Workshop or Slate. Review the documentation on building a compute module-backed function to get started using Palantir's TypeScript or Python SDKs.
* **Sync data into Foundry using custom containers:** Write a container that can be used to add data from custom sources into streams, datasets, or media sets. Review the documentation on building a compute module-backed pipeline to get started using Palantir's TypeScript or Python SDKs.
* **[Advanced]**  Integrate with any language by writing a custom client: To integrate a container in a language without using the dedicated SDKs, you can write a custom client implementing the compute module client specification.
